Parameter types:-
-----------------
Parameter Type	    Description
{int}	            Matches integers, for example 71 or -19. Converts to a 32-bit signed integer if the platform supports it.
{float}	            Matches floats, for example 3.6, .8 or -9.2. Converts to a 32 bit float if the platform supports it.
{word}	            Matches words without whitespace, for example banana (but not banana split).
{string}	        Matches single-quoted or double-quoted strings, for example "banana split" or 'banana split' (but not banana split).
                    Only the text between the quotes will be extracted. The quotes themselves are discarded.
                    Empty pairs of quotes are valid and will be matched and passed to step code as empty strings.
{} anonymous	    Matches anything (/.*/).
{bigdecimal}	    Matches the same as {float}, but converts to a BigDecimal if the platform supports it.
{double}	        Matches the same as {float}, but converts to a 64 bit float if the platform supports it.
{biginteger}	    Matches the same as {int}, but converts to a BigInteger if the platform supports it.
{byte}	            Matches the same as {int}, but converts to an 8 bit signed integer if the platform supports it.
{short}	            Matches the same as {int}, but converts to a 16 bit signed integer if the platform supports it.
{long}	            Matches the same as {int}, but converts to a 64 bit signed integer if the platform supports it.
